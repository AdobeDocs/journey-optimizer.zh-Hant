Adobe Journey Optimizer empowers you to deliver targeted, one-time content to specific audiences across multiple channels. Using campaigns, you can execute coordinated marketing actions simultaneously, reaching your audience with the right message at the right time.

This guide provides a clear roadmap to help you understand campaign fundamentals, choose the right campaign type for your use case, and confidently design campaigns that deliver impactful customer experiences.

## What are campaigns?

**Campaigns** are coordinated marketing actions that deliver content to a specific audience across one or more channels. Unlike journeys where actions execute sequentially, campaigns perform actions simultaneously—either immediately or on a defined schedule.

Use [!DNL Journey Optimizer] campaigns to:

* Deliver **one-time or recurring content** to targeted audience segments
* Execute **coordinated multi-channel communications** across email, push, SMS, in-app, web, and more
* Trigger **automated responses** via API calls for real-time, event-driven messaging
* Design **complex marketing workflows** with visual orchestration tools

## Choose your campaign type {#campaign-types}

**Before you start building**, it's important to understand which type of campaign fits your use case. Adobe Journey Optimizer supports three campaign types, each designed for different scenarios and activation mechanisms:

![](assets/campaign-modal.png)

>[!BEGINTABS]

>[!TAB Orchestrated campaigns]

**When to use:** Complex, multi-step marketing workflows

**Orchestrated campaigns** provide a visual, drag-and-drop canvas to design and automate sophisticated marketing workflows. From audience segmentation to personalized message delivery across channels, everything happens in one intuitive environment built for speed and control.

**Perfect for:** Multi-step customer engagement programs, complex segmentation and targeting strategies, cross-channel campaign orchestration, brand-initiated marketing at scale, and advanced workflow automation with multiple decision points.

➡️ [Learn about Orchestrated campaigns](../orchestrated/gs-orchestrated-campaigns.md)

>[!TAB Action campaigns (Scheduled)]

**When to use:** Simple, scheduled batch communications

**Action campaigns** (also known as Scheduled campaigns) are ideal for straightforward, one-off or recurring batch communications that run at a specific time.
    
**Two categories:**

* **Marketing** - Promotional offers, engagement campaigns, announcements, legal notices, or policy updates. Requires recipients to be opted in.
* **Transactional** - Disruptions, emergencies, cancellations. Does not require opt-in.

**Perfect for:** Monthly newsletters to customer segments, time-sensitive promotional announcements, seasonal marketing campaigns, product launch communications, and service disruption notifications.

➡️ [Learn about Action campaigns](create-campaign.md)

>[!TAB API triggered campaigns]

**When to use:** Real-time, event-driven messaging with external systems

**API-triggered campaigns** activate through API calls, enabling automated messaging directly from external systems. These campaigns support personalization using both profile attributes and real-time context data from the API payload.

**Two categories:**

* **Marketing** - Personalized marketing communications to targeted audiences
* **Transactional** - Messages following individual actions (password resets, cart purchases, etc.)

**Perfect for:** Password reset confirmations, cart abandonment recovery, order confirmations and shipping updates, account activity notifications, and real-time personalized recommendations.

➡️ [Learn about API-triggered campaigns](api-triggered-campaigns.md)

>[!ENDTABS]

>[!NOTE]
>
>Not sure which type to choose? Start with **Action campaigns** for scheduled batch communications or **API-triggered campaigns** for real-time messaging—these cover most common use cases.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Before working with campaigns, make sure you have the following in place:

* **Audiences** - Audiences must be available in Adobe Experience Platform before creating campaigns. [Get started with audiences →](../audience/about-audiences.md)

* **Channel configurations** - Channel configurations (presets) must be created and available for the channels you want to use. [Set up channel configurations →](../configuration/channel-surfaces.md)

* **Permissions** - You need appropriate permissions based on the campaign type. Contact your administrator if you cannot access campaign functionalities. [Learn about built-in roles →](../administration/ootb-product-profiles.md)

    +++Campaigns permissions list

    | Campaign type  |Permissions   |
    |-------------|---------------|
    | **Action campaigns** & **API triggered campaigns** | Campaign administrator<br>Campaign approver<br>Campaign manager<br>Campaign viewer |
    | **Orchestrated campaigns** | Orchestrated Campaign Administrator<br>Orchestrated Campaign Approver<br>Orchestrated Campaign Manager<br>Orchestrated Campaign Viewer |

    +++

    +++How to assign campaign permissions

    1. Navigate to the **[!UICONTROL Roles]** tab in the [!DNL Permissions] product and select one of the built-in campaign related **[!UICONTROL Roles]**.

    1. From the **[!UICONTROL Users]** tab, click **[!UICONTROL Add user]**.

    1. Type in your user's name or email address or select the user from the list and click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

    If the user was not previously created, refer to the [Add users documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/access-control/ui/users){target="_blank"}.

    Your user should then receive an email redirecting to your instance.

## Your campaign creation workflow {#workflow}

Building successful campaigns follows a clear, repeatable process. Here's your step-by-step workflow:

+++1. Plan your campaign

Before starting, clarify your objectives:

* **What's the goal?** (e.g., drive conversions, increase engagement, notify customers)
* **Who's the audience?** (e.g., build or select from Adobe Experience Platform)
* **Which campaign type fits?** (See [campaign types](#campaign-types) above)
* **What channels will you use?** (email, push, SMS, in-app, web, etc.) → [See supported channels by campaign type](../channels/gs-channels.md#channels)
* **When should it execute?** (immediate, scheduled, or API-triggered)

+++

+++2. Configure campaign properties

Set up the foundation of your campaign:

1. **Name and describe** your campaign for easy identification
2. **Select campaign type** (Action, API-triggered, or Orchestrated)
3. **Choose your audience** 
4. **Set priority** if using conflict management
5. **Configure schedule** (for Action campaigns) or API details (for API-triggered). For Action campaigns, you can also [send using waves](send-using-waves.md) to deliver the message in batches over time.

**Type-specific guides:** [Action campaign properties](campaign-properties.md) | [API-triggered campaign properties](api-triggered-campaign-properties.md) | [Orchestrated campaign setup](../orchestrated/create-orchestrated-campaign.md)

+++

+++3. Design your content

Create compelling messages for your audience:

* Use the **Email Designer** for rich email experiences
* Configure **push notifications** with images and deep links
* Design **SMS/RCS/MMS messages** with personalization
* Create **in-app** and **web** experiences
* Add **personalization** using profile attributes and contextual data

**Type-specific guides:** [Action campaign content](campaign-content.md) | [API-triggered campaign content](api-triggered-campaign-content.md) | [Orchestrated campaign content](../orchestrated/create-orchestrated-campaign.md)

+++

+++4. Review and test

Always review your campaign before activation:

* **Preview content** with test profiles
* **Check targeting** to ensure the right audience
* **Verify schedule** and activation settings
* **Request approval** if using the approval workflow
* **Test deliverability** with seed lists

**Type-specific guides:** [Review Action campaigns](review-activate-campaign.md) | [Review API-triggered campaigns](review-activate-api-triggered-campaign.md) | [Review Orchestrated campaigns](../orchestrated/create-orchestrated-campaign.md)

+++

+++5. Activate your campaign

Once review is complete, activate your campaign:

* **Manual activation** - Activate immediately or at scheduled time
* **API activation** - For API-triggered campaigns, use the activation endpoint
* **Approval process** - If required, wait for stakeholder approval

Note: Active campaigns cannot be edited (you must duplicate to make changes)

**Type-specific guides:** [Activate Action campaigns](review-activate-campaign.md) | [Activate API-triggered campaigns](review-activate-api-triggered-campaign.md) | [Activate Orchestrated campaigns](../orchestrated/create-orchestrated-campaign.md)

+++

+++6. Monitor and analyze

Track how your campaign performs:

* View campaign reports and analytics
* Monitor delivery rates and engagement metrics
* Track errors and bounces
* Analyze conversion and ROI
* Use insights for optimization

**Type-specific guides:** [Action campaign reports](../reports/campaign-global-report-cja.md) | [API-triggered campaign monitoring](api-triggered-campaigns.md#monitor) | [Orchestrated campaign analytics](../orchestrated/create-orchestrated-campaign.md)

**Send Time Optimization for mobile messaging**

Let AI determine the best moment to reach each individual recipient on SMS, RCS, and WhatsApp. Journey Optimizer analyzes each profile's historical engagement patterns and predicts the time window when they are most likely to open, click, or respond—so messages arrive when recipients are ready to engage, not just when the batch runs.

Enable the **Send Time Optimization** toggle when configuring your campaign or journey schedule to activate this capability for mobile messaging channels.
