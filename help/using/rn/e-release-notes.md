### Improvements

- **Approval policy permissions**
  Added an option when creating or setting Approval Policy to prevent Journey/Campaign creators from approving their own objects.

- **New Journey Alerts**  
  New pre-configured alerts are available for journeys:  
  - Profile Discard Rate Exceeded: Ratio of profile discards to entered profiles over the last 5 mins exceeded threshold.  
  - Custom Action Error Rate Exceeded: Ratio of custom action errors to successful HTTP calls over the last 5 mins exceeded threshold.  
  - Profile Error Rate Exceeded: Ratio of profiles-in-error to entered profiles over the last 5 mins exceeded threshold.

- **Nested JSON body params now supported in custom authentication**  
  When configuring custom authentication for a custom action, nested JSON objects (e.g., sub-objects within `bodyParams`) are now supported.

- **Attach fragments to decision items**  
  Journey Optimizer now provides the ability to attach fragments to decision items which can be leveraged in code-based experience campaigns through decision policies.

- **Custom attributes support with One-click unsubscribe URL**  
  With Journey Optimizer, if you are managing consent outside of Adobe, you can set an external custom endpoint by defining your own one-click unsubscribe link in the email configuration. When your recipients click the unsubscribe link, Journey Optimizer appends some default profile-specific parameters to the consent update event. 

  To further personalize the unsubscribe email address, you can now define custom attributes that will be appended to the consent event. This capability has already been available for the custom one-click unsubscribe link since the August 25 release.

- ***mTLS Support for SMS Channel**
  When setting up a custom SMS provider, you now have the option to enable mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication, which requires both the client and the server to confirm each other's identities before a secure connection is established.

- **Model-based Schemas**  
  For a clearer and more intuitive experience, Relational Schemas are now referred to as Model-based Schemas in Orchestrated campaigns.

- **Dataset lookup support in journeys**  
  A new activity in journeys, **Dataset lookup**, allows you to dynamically retrieve data from Adobe Experience Platform record datasets during runtime. By leveraging this capability, you can access data that may not reside in the profile or event payload, ensuring your customer interactions are both relevant and timely.

- **Simulating content variations for all inbound channels**  
  Previously only available for the Email, SMS, and Push notification channels, simulating content variations now also applies to all inbound channels.

- **Webhook support for API triggered campaigns**  
  API triggered campaigns now support webhooks. Configure a webhook URL to receive real-time status updates for every message, improving observability and enabling seamless monitoring and automation.

- **Redirect Support in Journey Custom Actions**  
  Redirects (302) are now supported in Journey Custom Actions.

- **High throughput mode for API triggered email campaigns**  
  A new High throughput mode is now available in API triggered campaigns. This mode is designed for large-scale, real-time messaging (up to 5000 transactions per second) and provides higher availability with lower latency.  
  This capability is only available for the email channel, for organizations that have purchased the Adobe High throughput transactional messaging add-on offering. Contact your Adobe representative for more details.


- **Hourly reset capping frequency** - You can now apply capping on an hourly basis for channel rule sets. Previously available in Limited Availability, this capability is now available to all environments and allows you to choose 1 hour (previously 3 hours).
