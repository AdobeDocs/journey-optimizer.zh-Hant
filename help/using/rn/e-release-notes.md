<p>You can schedule outbound messages from <strong>campaigns</strong> or <strong>journeys</strong> to be delivered in controlled <strong>batches</strong> over time.</p>
<p>Wave sending offers the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better <strong>deliverability</strong> – Spread sends over time to help maintain a strong <strong>sender reputation</strong> and reduce the risk of being flagged as spam.</li>
<li><strong>Load control</strong> – Avoid overwhelming downstream systems (e.g. call centers, landing pages) by limiting how many messages go out at once.</li>
<li>High-volume and time-sensitive use cases – Suited to large audiences or when you need to control timing (e.g. call center capacity, ramp-up, or time-bound offers).</li>

### Improvements {#feb-26-01-improv}

Improvements coming with this release are listed below.

#### Configuration

* **Experience event usage in journey expressions** - Starting April 1, 2026, the use of experience event attributes in journey expressions will no longer be supported for organizations that have not used this capability in the last 90 days. This capability has already been unavailable for new customer organizations since July 8, 2025. For alternatives, see [Experience event lookup in journeys](../building-journeys/exp-event-lookup.md).


* **Subdomain delegation method switching** - You can now switch from one <strong>subdomain delegation</strong> method to another. This enables you to migrate domains using the <strong>CNAME delegation</strong> mode to the <strong>custom delegation</strong> method to adhere to your company's security policies.

  **Note**: This capability is only available for a set of organizations (<strong>Limited Availability</strong>). To gain access, contact your Adobe representative.


#### Email Designer

* **Use a brand theme to convert an image to an email template** - When converting an image to an email template in Journey Optimizer, you can now use a <strong>theme</strong> as input so the generated HTML follows your <strong>brand parameters</strong>. Styling such as background color, button color, fonts, line spacing, margins, and padding is applied automatically, reducing manual design work and delivering a template that is ready to use with minimal edits.


* **Update brands with new color tab** - <strong>Brand guidelines</strong> help ensure your brand is presented consistently across all touchpoints. The new <strong>Colors section</strong> defines the standards for your brand's color system, outlining how colors are selected, organized, and applied across experiences. It ensures consistent use of primary, secondary, accent, and neutral colors to support a cohesive, accessible, and recognizable brand identity.


#### AI

* **Integration of custom Firefly models and third-party image generation models** - Enable seamless integration of standard and custom <strong>Firefly models</strong>, along with approved <strong>third-party image models</strong> (e.g., NanoBanana), to provide greater flexibility, control, and brand alignment when generating images. This allows you to select the best model for each use case: standard Firefly for general needs, custom Firefly for on-brand generation, or approved third-party models for specialized or experimental scenarios.


#### Experience Decisioning

* **Edge inbound support for using Adobe Experience Platform data in Decisioning** - Decisioning support of <strong>Experience Platform data lookup</strong> now includes <strong>edge inbound</strong> channel use cases. The capability remains in Limited Availability; General Availability of the underlying data lookup feature is not yet announced (AEP/product dependency).

  **Note**: This capability is only available for a set of organizations (<strong>Limited Availability</strong>). To gain access, contact your Adobe representative.


* **Experience Decisioning preview in Code-based Experience channel** - You can now preview <strong>decision items</strong> when configuring <strong>Experience Decisioning</strong> with the <strong>Code-based Experience</strong> channel. Preview is available directly in the authoring interface before going live.


* **Offer Ranking AI Model Observability** - Journey Optimizer now allows you to monitor the <strong>health</strong>, <strong>training status</strong>, and <strong>performance</strong> of your <strong>AI models</strong> in Decisioning—so you can verify training success, troubleshoot failures, and understand impact on your outcomes. This capability is available for personalized optimization models only (not auto-optimization).


* **Attach fragments to decision items** - Journey Optimizer now provides the ability to attach <strong>fragments</strong> to <strong>decision items</strong> which can be leveraged in code-based experience campaigns through <strong>decision policies</strong>.

  **Note**: Previously released in Limited Availability, this capability is now available to all environments (General Availability).

  Availability date: February 12, 2026.


#### Journeys

* **Multiple inbound actions in journeys** - To simplify your journey orchestration, you can now define several <strong>inbound actions</strong> in a single journey. Previously available in campaigns, this capability enables you to deliver multiple <strong>code-based experiences</strong>, <strong>in-app messages</strong>, <strong>content cards</strong>, or <strong>web actions</strong> to different locations at the same time, each action containing specific content.

  **Note**: Previously released in Limited Availability, this capability is now available to all environments (General Availability).


* **SMS Webhooks** - <strong>Webhooks</strong> are now supported across all SMS providers. You can configure each webhook based on its intended purpose: <strong>Inbound webhooks</strong> to capture incoming messages and <strong>Feedback webhooks</strong> to receive delivery receipts, status updates, and other message-related events. [Read more](../sms/sms-webhook.md)

  Availability date: February 2, 2026.
