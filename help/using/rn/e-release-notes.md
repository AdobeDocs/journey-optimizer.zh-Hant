### Improvements {#jan-26-01-improv}

Improvements coming with this release are listed below.

#### AI

* **AI Assistant Content Quality Checks** - In addition to brand alignment, you can now evaluate overall <strong>content quality</strong> to uncover potential issues with readability, cohesiveness, and effectiveness, independent of your brand guidelines. These automated checks help identify unclear messaging, inconsistent tone, or structural gaps.

* **Update brands with new color tab** - Brand guidelines help ensure your brand is presented consistently across all touchpoints. The new <strong>Colors section</strong> defines the standards for your brand's color system, outlining how colors are selected, organized, and applied across experiences. It ensures consistent use of primary, secondary, accent, and neutral colors to support a cohesive, accessible, and recognizable brand identity.
