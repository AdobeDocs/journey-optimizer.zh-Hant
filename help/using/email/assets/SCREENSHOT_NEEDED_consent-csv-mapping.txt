SCREENSHOT NEEDED: consent-csv-mapping.png

For DOCAC-8403 - Opt-in/opt-out profiles from a file

Location: email-opt-out.md, section "Manage opt-in/opt-out from a file"

Description:
Screenshot showing the CSV to XDM schema mapping interface in Adobe Experience Platform Workflows.

The screenshot should show:
1. The "Map CSV to XDM schema" workflow interface
2. CSV columns on the left side (email, firstname, lastname, consent)
3. XDM schema fields on the right side with mappings:
   - email → personalEmail.address (or similar identity field)
   - consent → consents.marketing.email.val
   - firstname → person.name.firstName (optional)
   - lastname → person.name.lastName (optional)
4. The mapping interface with dropdown selectors or field mapping UI

This screenshot will help users understand how to correctly map their CSV columns to the appropriate consent fields in the XDM schema.

Alternative: If a real screenshot is not available, consider using a similar screenshot from the test profiles CSV upload process (test-profiles-19.png) as a reference and creating a new one specific to consent mapping.
